Hey $BOB,
I saw your presentation at $CONFERENCE last year on Youtube (rr point to some work they have done).
Great stuff; loved what you did with $FOO, in particular
$COMMENT_PROVING_YOU_KNOW_WHAT_YOU'RE_TALKING_ABOUT.
I'm also a $FOO developer. I noticed that your company is hiring
or $ROLE. Iâ€™d love to be a part of your team. Do you have a
few minutes to chat on Thursday about what you guys are doing?
 
Thanks,
Yourname
Your website or any public profile lin
