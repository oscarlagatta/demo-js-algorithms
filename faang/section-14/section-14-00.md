Queues

Implement the class Queue using stacks. The queue methods you need to implement are enqueue, dequeue, peek, and emtpy.

enqueue: append a value to the end of the queue.
dequeue: removes the value at the start of the queue
peek: return the value at the start of the queue.
empty: boolean value whether the queue has no elements


Constraints


Do the queue methods we have to implement need to perform at the same complexity of a real queue?
No, but they should be as performant as possible.
